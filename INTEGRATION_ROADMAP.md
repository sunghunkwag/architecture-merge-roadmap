# Integration Roadmap for Cross-Repository AGI Architecture Unification

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This document outlines a phased, practical roadmap for unifying the architectures and codebases of five advanced AGI agent repositories (EFCA-v2-Architecture, AGI-HRM-Blueprint, ADAPT-EFCA-v2-orchestrator, compass-artifact-wf, efca-adapt-ag) into a coherent, modular, and scalable AGI system. The roadmap is designed as a real-world engineering guide, focusing on both technical and collaborative challenges.

## 2. Target Architectures/Repositories
- **EFCA-v2-Architecture:** Hierarchical predictive coding, meta-controller & global workspace agents
- **AGI-HRM-Blueprint:** Information-theoretic, multi-timescale, mathematically rigorous hierarchical learning
- **ADAPT-EFCA-v2-orchestrator:** Dual-loop RSI meta-agent demonstrator, safety/uncertainty layers
- **compass-artifact-wf:** Production-grade, neuromorphic/analog-digital distributed architecture
- **efca-adapt-ag:** Service-oriented meta-RL agent with API, infrastructure, and curiosity-driven learning

## 3. Integration Goals
- Achieve modular interoperability with minimal coupling between components.
- Standardize core APIs/interfaces for environment, agency, memory, and meta-control logic.
- Support neuromorphic and digital hybrid workflows.
- Enable scalable development, testing, and benchmarking across domains.
- Maintain backward compatibility where practicable.

## 4. Integration Phases

### Phase 1: Survey & Analysis
- Document each repoâ€™s architecture (core modules, APIs, data flows, dependencies).
- Identify all overlap and divergence in structure/purpose.

### Phase 2: Interface & Data Schema Standardization
- Define canonical API contracts (types, endpoints, payloads) for agent-environment, policy, memory, metacognition.
- Align core data structures (e.g., state, action, reward, uncertainty metrics).

### Phase 3: Adapter & Bridge Layer Development
- Implement adapters to bridge incompatible module interfaces for common test scenarios.
- Prototype translation layers (e.g., action/state wrappers, memory marshalling).

### Phase 4: Sequential Integration & Test Harnessing
- Integrate components incrementally, validating data flow and behavioral correctness at each step.
- Develop common test suites, RL environments, and API mocks.

### Phase 5: Service Composition & Distributed Orchestration
- Refactor modules as services where possible (FastAPI, gRPC, microservice, K8s).
- Set up orchestration environment for agent composition and deployment.

### Phase 6: Expert Validation & Optimization
- Solicit reviews from domain experts on safety, learning stability, and scalability.
- Optimize for performance, latency, and reliability.

## 5. Technical Challenges & Mitigation

| Challenge                       | Mitigation                                         |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Incompatible data schemas        | Early schema workshops; canonical mapping modules  |
| API surface fragmentation        | Contract-first API design and documentation        |
| Heterogeneous runtime/platforms  | Dockerization, abstraction layers                  |
| RL/reward/uncertainty differences| Modular reward wrappers, unit tests                |
| Neuromorphic/digital bridge      | Define hardware abstraction & interface contracts  |
| Governance and contributions     | Clear ownership, contribution and review process   |

## 6. API/Interface Standardization Approach
- Adopt REST/gRPC and Python typing for cross-module APIs.
- Provide OpenAPI/Protobuf schema specs for all public endpoints.
- Each service/module includes reference tests and type checking.

## 7. Integration Timeline (Recommended)
- **Phase 1-2:** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3-4:** 4-8 weeks (parallelizable)
- **Phase 5:** 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 6:** 2 weeks +
- *Total*: 10-16 weeks (with staging/demos after each major milestone)

## 8. Success Criteria
- All core modules interoperable via defined APIs without hard-coding.
- Full end-to-end agent workflow (env <-> agent <-> meta <-> memory) runs on demo env with passing test suite.
- Documentation and interface guides complete and usable for new contributors.
- Validation by third-party expert reviewers.

## 9. Ownership and Collaboration
- Each source repo maintains a module lead responsible for integration effort.
- All interface changes must be reviewed/approved by at least two module leads.
- Use GitHub Issues/PRs for tracking; regular sync meetings recommended.

## 10. References
- Individual repo architecture docs and READMEs
- AGI research on modular and meta-reinforcement learning
- OpenAPI/Protobuf/Service mesh best practices
- Neuromorphic-software integration publications (2024-2025)
