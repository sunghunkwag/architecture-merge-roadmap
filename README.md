# architecture-merge-roadmap

## Project Overview

Integration Roadmap and Plan for Cross-Repository AGI Architecture Unification

This repository serves as the central coordination hub for merging and integrating architectural components across multiple AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) repositories. Our goal is to create a unified, scalable, and maintainable architecture that consolidates best practices, shared modules, and cross-cutting concerns from diverse AGI projects.

## Extended Project Description

The **architecture-merge-roadmap** project aims to:

- **Unify Disparate Codebases**: Consolidate architectures from multiple repositories into a coherent system
- **Standardize Best Practices**: Establish coding standards, design patterns, and architectural guidelines
- **Improve Maintainability**: Create clear documentation and modular structures for easier collaboration
- **Enable Scalability**: Design systems that can grow with increasing complexity and team size
- **Foster Collaboration**: Provide clear pathways for contributors to participate in the integration effort

### Key Objectives

1. **Assessment Phase**: Evaluate existing repositories and identify common patterns
2. **Design Phase**: Create unified architecture diagrams and integration plans
3. **Implementation Phase**: Execute the merge with minimal disruption
4. **Testing Phase**: Ensure all integrated components work harmoniously
5. **Documentation Phase**: Provide comprehensive guides for ongoing development
6. **Deployment Phase**: Roll out the unified architecture across all projects
7. **Maintenance Phase**: Establish processes for continuous improvement

## Key Files and Structure

## Core Code Artifacts and Review Guidelines

This section references essential code artifacts, diagrams, and processes that ensure quality and consistency throughout the project lifecycle.

### Core Artifacts

- **[adapter_example.py](adapter_example.py)**: Reference implementation demonstrating adapter pattern and integration best practices
- **[api_spec/openapi.yml](api_spec/openapi.yml)**: OpenAPI specification defining standardized API contracts and interfaces
- **[FLOWCHART.md](FLOWCHART.md)**: Visual workflow documentation showing system integration flows and decision points
- **[checklist.md](checklist.md)**: Comprehensive quality checklist covering all project phases (see Phase 5 for code/diagram review guidelines)
- **[diagrams/](diagrams/)**: Directory containing architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and visual documentation
- **[.github/](.github/)**: GitHub templates for issues, pull requests, and workflow automation

### Code Review Process

> **⚠️ Important**: All code contributions must undergo peer review before merging. See [checklist.md Phase 5](checklist.md#phase-5-code-and-diagram-review-best-practices) for detailed guidelines.

**Key Review Requirements:**
- Review code for adherence to project coding standards and architectural patterns
- Verify that all public interfaces are documented with clear docstrings
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation
- Check for test coverage of new functionality
- Validate that code changes align with API specifications in `api_spec/openapi.yml`
- Confirm integration points match patterns shown in `adapter_example.py`

### Diagram Expectations

> **📊 Diagram Standards**: All architectural changes require corresponding diagram updates. Visual documentation is critical for maintaining shared understanding.

**Diagram Requirements:**
- Update diagrams in the `diagrams/` directory when modifying system architecture
- Ensure flowcharts in `FLOWCHART.md` reflect current integration workflows
- Use consistent notation and styling across all visual documentation
- Include legends and annotations for complex diagrams
- Review diagrams with stakeholders before finalizing architectural changes

### Best Practices for Code and Diagram Maintenance

**Code Maintenance:**
1. **Keep Code and Documentation in Sync**: Update relevant documentation files when changing implementations
2. **Follow the Adapter Pattern**: Reference `adapter_example.py` when creating new integration adapters
3. **Maintain API Contracts**: Coordinate with API specification owners before breaking changes
4. **Write Self-Documenting Code**: Use clear variable names and add comments for complex logic
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing new features when possible

**Diagram Maintenance:**
1. **Update Diagrams Promptly**: Don't let visual documentation drift from implementation reality
2. **Version Control for Diagrams**: Store diagram source files (not just images) in the repository
3. **Regular Review Cycles**: Schedule periodic diagram reviews to ensure accuracy
4. **Accessible Formats**: Export diagrams in multiple formats (SVG, PNG) for different use cases
5. **Collaborative Editing**: Use tools that support collaborative diagram creation and review

**For complete code and diagram review guidelines, see [checklist.md Phase 5](checklist.md#phase-5-code-and-diagram-review-best-practices).**
